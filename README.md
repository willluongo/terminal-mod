terminal-mod
============

Modified [terminal theme for Adium](http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=7014).

So far it is just a little tweaking for the display formatting. In the future? WHO KNOWS.

## Installation

There may be better ways to install this theme, but I like this one:

```
git clone https://github.com/willluongo/terminal-mod.git ~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Message Styles/Terminal.AdiumMessageStyle
```
